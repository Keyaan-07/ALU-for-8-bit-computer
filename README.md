ALU-for-8-bit-computer
hey, i started this project a long time ago, before joining slack, and left it in the middle, but now, i am rebuilding it. I had already built: clock, program counter, 2 registers. now, i'll be continuing to build it, starting with the ALU. 

this design is based on the albert paul mavino and ben eater design. It only has addition and subtraction functions because it is a very basic(SAP-1) computer.
please note that connecting wires, each of which is made exactly as long as it needs to be, is a time taking process.so, even if i had added only few wires, it took a long time to do so.

## session 1: 
wired the ALU chips, 74ls283 and 74ls86. 4 bit full adder and 4 XOR gates, to the Registers(A and B). now, internal wiring of ALU is left which is for the next session. some pictures and a video are attached below.

## session 2:
added all the internal wiring left. Now i dont have any wires left lol. that is why i added a different coloured wire in the last joint. i have to get the blue coloured one from school now lol. next session will be based on checking(and probably troubleshooting) the ALU. here are the images and the videos:
