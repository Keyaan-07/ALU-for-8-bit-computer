ALU-for-8-bit-computer
hey, i started this project a long time ago, before joining slack, and left it in the middle, but now, i am rebuilding it. I had already built: clock, program counter, 2 registers. now, i'll be continuing to build it, starting with the ALU. 

this design is based on the albert paul mavino and ben eater design. 
please note that connecting wires, each of which ismade exactly as long as it needs to be, is a time taking process.

session 1: 
wired the ALU chips, 74ls283 and 74ls86. 4 bit full adder and 4 XOR gates, to the Registers(A and B). now, internal wiring of ALU is left which is for the next session. some pictures and a video are attached below.
